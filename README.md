# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

It is crucial that the project meet all the deadlines so that it can stay on schedule. Failure to do this results in the project
taking longer to complete and it becomes more costly.Project managers ensure timely delivery by using effective communication, risk managemenr, resource allocation and quality management techniques.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

It ensures that the project stays within budegt and prevents budget overruns. Strategies that can be used are resource management, risk management and quality management.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

The Agile Methododlogy is an iterative, flexible and incremental approach, while the Waterfall Methodology is linear, step by step and rigid.
Agile is advantageous in that it's flexible, works on user feedback and responds quickly to any changes.i Its cons, however, are that it's less pedictable in terms of structure and it needs a lot of customer involvement. Waterfalls advantages are that it has documentation and a clear rigid structure and its easy to manage because of it. Its cons are that it's difficult to accomodate any changes and any type of testing happens late in the process.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
The Agile approach is more beneficial in projects that need constant changes made to them, like an online game that runs on a server, Genshin Impact. 
Genshin Impact is an MMORPG that has a new patch added to it every 6 weeks, so it makes sense to use the agile method. Waterfall is better used for a project
that will need little to no changes made to it, such as the NASA website. The content they publish on it is likely to not change in a short period of time, so the waterfall method is beneficial.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
They are code reviews, automated testing and version control. In order to avoid technical debt and to identify project defects.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

It gives us clear boundaries on what the project can include or exclude, ensures that it aligns with the stakeholders objectives i starting this project, and allows easier risk management and resource allocation. A work breakdown structure is a way to breakdown a project into smaller, more manageable parts. This helps organize the project, assign tasks and improves the communication among team members.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

It provies a clear timeline, enables progress tracking, coordination, and resource management. Gnatt Charts assist in this by providing a visual representation of the project schedule, making all tasks easier to understand.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The core issues that it aims to address is the lack of financial literacy and good spending habits in disadvantaged areas. They're significant because, growing up, we were told by our parents that money was not abundant and we had to survive with what we could, when in reality, said parents were horrendous at money management and suffering was caused unnecesarily.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

A clearly defined problem helps in scope management by setting the boundaries for the project, and it provides a clear focus for the development team.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

Our app helps you understand money with fun animations. Learn how to budget, save, and invest in a simple and enjoyable way. Perfect for anyone who wants to get better at managing their finances without feeling overwhelmed.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

A fun and interactve animated character that pops up every time you change tabs on the app.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

Statistics relating to the number of people formally educated in financial literacy and those who are not

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
By analysing market competition, identifying user needs, adapting to changes in the market, and finding our target market.
